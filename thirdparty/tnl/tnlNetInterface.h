/// NetInterface class.
///
/// Manages all valid and pending notify protocol connections for a port/IP. If you are
/// providing multiple services or servicing multiple networks, you may have more than
/// one NetInterface.
///
/// <b>Connection handshaking basic overview:</b>
///
/// TNL does a two phase connect handshake to prevent a several types of
/// Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
///
/// The initiator of the connection (client) starts the connection by sending
/// a unique random nonce (number, used once) value to the server as part of
/// the ConnectChallengeRequest packet.
/// C->S: ConnectChallengeRequest, Nc
///
/// The server responds to the ConnectChallengeRequest with a "Client Puzzle"
/// that has the property that verifying a solution to the puzzle is computationally
/// simple, but can be of a specified computational, brute-force difficulty to
/// compute the solution itself.  The client puzzle is of the form:
/// secureHash(Ic, Nc, Ns, X) = Y >> k, where Ic is the identity of the client,
/// and X is a value computed by the client such that the high k bits of the value
/// y are all zero.  The client identity is computed by the server as a partial hash
/// of the client's IP address and port and some random data on the server.
/// its current nonce (Ns), Nc, k, and the server's authentication certificate.
/// S->C: ConnectChallengeResponse, Nc, Ns, Ic, Cs
///
/// The client, upon receipt of the ConnectChallengeResponse, validates the packet
/// sent by the server and computes a solution to the puzzle the server sent.  If
/// the connection is to be authenticated, the client can also validate the server's
/// certificate (if it's been signed by a Certificate Authority), and then generates
/// a shared secret from the client's key pair and the server's public key.  The client
/// response to the server consists of:
/// C->S: ConnectRequest, Nc, Ns, X, Cc, sharedSecret(key1, sequence1, NetConnectionClass, class-specific sendData)
///
/// The server then can validation the solution to the puzzle the client submitted, along
/// with the client identity (Ic).
/// Until this point the server has allocated no memory for the client and has
/// verified that the client is sending from a valid IP address, and that the client
/// has done some amount of work to prove its willingness to start a connection.
/// As the server load increases, the server may choose to increase the difficulty (k) of
/// the client puzzle, thereby making a resource depletion DoS attack successively more
/// difficult to launch.
///
/// If the server accepts the connection, it sends a connect accept packet that is
/// encrypted and hashed using the shared secret.  The contents of the packet are
/// another sequence number (sequence2) and another key (key2).  The sequence numbers 
/// are the initial send and receive sequence numbers for the connection, and the
/// key2 value becomes the IV of the symmetric cipher.  The connection subclass is
/// also allowed to write any connection specific data into this packet.
///
/// This system can operate in one of 3 ways: unencrypted, encrypted key exchange (ECDH),
/// or encrypted key exchange with server and/or client signed certificates (ECDSA).
/// 
/// The unencrypted communication mode is NOT secure.  Packets en route between hosts
/// can be modified without detection by the hosts at either end.  Connections using
/// the secure key exchange are still vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks, but still
/// much more secure than the unencrypted channels.  Using certificate(s) signed by a
/// trusted certificate authority (CA), makes the communications channel as securely
/// trusted as the trust in the CA.
///
/// <b>Arranged Connection handshaking:</b>
///
/// NetInterface can also facilitate "arranged" connections.  Arranged connections are
/// necessary when both parties to the connection are behind firewalls or NAT routers.
/// Suppose there are two clients, A and B that want to esablish a direct connection with
/// one another.  If A and B are both logged into some common server S, then S can send
/// A and B the public (NAT'd) address, as well as the IP addresses each client detects
/// for itself.
///
/// A and B then both send "Punch" packets to the known possible addresses of each other.
/// The punch packet client A sends enables the punch packets client B sends to be 
/// delivered through the router or firewall since it will appear as though it is a service
/// response to A's initial packet.
///
/// Upon receipt of the Punch packet by the "initiator"
/// of the connection, an ArrangedConnectRequest packet is sent.
/// if the non-initiator of the connection gets an ArrangedPunch
/// packet, it simply sends another Punch packet to the
/// remote host, but narrows down its Address range to the address
/// it received the packet from.
/// The ArrangedPunch packet from the intiator contains the nonce 
/// for the non-initiator, and the nonce for the initiator encrypted
/// with the shared secret.
/// The ArrangedPunch packet for the receiver of the connection
/// contains all that, plus the public key/keysize or the certificate
/// of the receiver.
