/// Superclass for ghostable networked objects.
///
/// @section NetObject_intro Introduction To NetObject And Ghosting
///
/// One of the most powerful aspects of the Torque Network Library is its support
/// for ghosting and prioritized, most-recent-state network updates. The way
/// this works is a bit complex, but it is immensely efficient. Let's run
/// through the steps that the server goes through for each client in this part
/// of TNL's architecture:
///      - First, the server determines what objects are in-scope for the client.
///        This is done by calling performScopeQuery() on the object which is
///        considered the "scope" object. This could be a simulation avatar of the character,
///        a flyby camera, a vehicle the user is controlling, or something else.
///      - Second, it instructs the client to create "ghost" instances of those objects
///        to represent the source objects on the server.  Finally, it sends updates
///        to the ghosts of those objects whose state has been updated on the server,
///        prioritizing the updates based on how relevant the object is to that particular client.
///
/// There several significant advantages to using this networking system:
///      - Efficient network usage, since we only send data that has changed. In addition,
///        since we only care about most-recent data, if a packet is dropped, we don't waste
///        effort trying to deliver stale data.
///      - Cheating protection; since TNL doesn't deliver information about game objects which
///        aren't "in scope", the ability for clients to learn about objects outside their immediate
///        perceptions can be curtailed by an agressive scoping function.
///
/// @section NetObject_Implementation An Example Implementation
///
/// The basis of the ghost implementation in TNL is NetObject.  Each NetObject maintains an <b>updateMask</b>,
/// a 32 bit word representing up to 32 independent states for the object.  When a NetObject's state changes
/// it calls the setMaskBits method to notify the network layer that the state has changed and needs to be
/// updated on all clients that have that NetObject in scope.
///
/// Using a NetObject is very simple; let's go through a simple example implementation:
///
/// @code
/// class SimpleNetObject : public NetObject
/// {
/// public:
///   typedef NetObject Parent;
///   TNL_DECLARE_CLASS(SimpleNetObject);
/// @endcode
///
/// Above is the standard boilerplate code for a NetObject subclass.
///
/// @code
///    char message1[256];
///    char message2[256];
///    enum States {
///       Message1Mask = BIT(0),
///       Message2Mask = BIT(1),
///    };
/// @endcode
///
/// The example class has two object "states" that each instance keeps track of, message1 and message2.
/// A real game object might have states for health, velocity and position, or some other set of fields.
/// Each class has 32 bits to work with, so it's possible to be very specific when defining states.
/// In general, individual state bits should be assigned only to things that are updated independently -
/// so if you update the position field and the velocity at the same time always, you could use a single
/// bit to represent that state change.
///
/// @code
///    SimpleNetObject()
///    {
///       // in order for an object to be considered by the network system,
///       // the Ghostable net flag must be set.
///       // the ScopeAlways flag indicates that the object is always scoped
///       // on all active connections.
///       mNetFlags.set(ScopeAlways | Ghostable);
///       strcpy(message1, "Hello World 1!");
///       strcpy(message2, "Hello World 2!");
///    }
/// @endcode
///
/// Here is the constructor. The code initializes the net flags, indicating that
/// the SimpleNetObject should always be scoped, and that it can be ghosted to remote hosts
///
/// @code
///    U32 packUpdate(GhostConnection *, U32 mask, BitStream *stream)
///    {
///       // check which states need to be updated, and write updates
///       if(stream->writeFlag(mask & Message1Mask))
///          stream->writeString(message1);
///       if(stream->writeFlag(mask & Message2Mask))
///          stream->writeString(message2);
///
///       // the return value from packUpdate can set which states still
///       // need to be updated for this object.
///       return 0;
///    }
/// @endcode
///
/// Here's half of the meat of the networking code, the packUpdate() function. (The other half, unpackUpdate(),
/// is shown below.) The comments in the code pretty much explain everything, however, notice that the
/// code follows a pattern of if(writeFlag(mask & StateMask)) { ... write data ... }. The packUpdate()/unpackUpdate()
/// functions are responsible for reading and writing the update flags to the BitStream.  This means the GhostConnection
/// doesn't have to send the 32 bit updateMask with every packet.
///
/// @code
///    void unpackUpdate(GhostConnection *, BitStream *stream)
///    {
///       // the unpackUpdate function must be symmetrical to packUpdate
///       if(stream->readFlag())
///       {
///          stream->readString(message1);
///          logprintf("Got message1: %s", message1);
///       }
///       if(stream->readFlag())
///       {
///          stream->readString(message2);
///          logprintf("Got message2: %s", message2);
///       }
///    }
/// @endcode
///
/// The other half of the networking code in any NetObject, unpackUpdate(). In SimpleNetObject, all
/// the code does is print the new messages to the log; however, in a more advanced object, the code might
/// trigger animations, update complex object properties, or even spawn new objects, based on what packet
/// data is unpacked.
///
/// @code
///    void setMessage1(const char *msg)
///    {
///       setMaskBits(Message1Mask);
///       strcpy(message1, msg);
///    }
///    void setMessage2(const char *msg)
///    {
///       setMaskBits(Message2Mask);
///       strcpy(message2, msg);
///    }
/// @endcode
///
/// Here are the accessors for the two properties. It is good to encapsulate state
/// variables, so that you don't have to remember to make a call to setMaskBits every time you change
/// anything; the accessors can do it for you. In a more complex object, you might need to set
/// multiple mask bits when you change something; this can be done using the | operator, for instance,
/// setMaskBits( Message1Mask | Message2Mask ); if you changed both messages.
///
/// @code
/// TNL_IMPLEMENT_NETOBJECT(SimpleNetObject);
/// @endcode
///
/// Finally, we use the NetObject implementation macro, TNL_IMPLEMENT_NETOBJECT(), to implement our
/// NetObject. It is important that we use this, as it makes TNL perform certain initialization tasks
/// that allow us to send the object over the network. TNL_IMPLEMENT_CLASS() doesn't perform these tasks, see
/// the documentation on NetClassRep for more details.
