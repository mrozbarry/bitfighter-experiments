@page changelog Torque Network Layer Upgrade Guide

@section changelog_intro Introduction

TNL is a living, changing body of code. Things become superceded, outdated, deprecated. As a developer, you are probably interested in keeping up to date with the latest features in TNL - which means you have to upgrade your code to work with changes to the layer.

With such a large project as TNL, it is difficult to  make sure that you're fully up to synch with a changing target. This section of the documentation describes changes to the engine in each version, along with what you need to do to get your code up to date, so that everything works together smoothly.
